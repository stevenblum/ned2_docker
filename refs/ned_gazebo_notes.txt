Needs to be on ubuntu 18 and ros melodic

### FROM CHAT GPT
and why even though roslibpy is nominally installed, the version you have (2.0.0) doesn’t include the actionlib submodule — that subpackage was removed in later versions of roslibpy.

The Niryo ROS 2 driver (niryo_ned_ros2_driver) was built for roslibpy==1.6.x, where roslibpy.actionlib still existed.



I watched a video that included these steps:

Prerequisites:
- Ubuntu 18.04
- ROS Melodic
- build-essential
- sqlite3
- ffmpeg

METHOD 1: Quick Installation via rosdepFor each package, we have referenced all the dependies in their respective package.xml, which allows to install each dependencey via rosdep command:
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --default-yes --rosdistro melodic --skip-keys "python-rps.gpio"

METHOD 2: Manual Installation of Dependencies
ROS Packages that are needed:
- catkin
- python-catkin-pkg
- python-pymodbus
- python-rosdistro
- python-rospkg
- python-rosdep-modules

- python-rosinstall-generator
- python-wstool

Melodic Specific Packages that are needed:

# THE VIDEOS SPECIFC STEPS:
mkdir -p ned_sim_tut/src
cd ned_sim_tut/src
git clone https://github.com/NiryoRobotics/ned_ros.git
ls 
cd ..
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths src ---ignore-src --default-yes --rosdistro melodic --skip-keys "python-rpt.gpto"
catkin_make
source devel/setupbash.
echo "source $(pwd)/devel/setup.bash"
source ~/.bashrc

Also, he said The python environment is installed with the requirements_ned2.txt
But he didnt show this, but I would like to include it, or a similar command
> pip2 install -r src/requirements_ned2.txt

New Terminal:
gedit ~/.bashrc
# Commenting out previous workspace directory

roscore # Verify roscore is working

# New Terminal
roslaunch niryo_robot_description display.launch

# New Terminal
roslaunch niryo_robot_bringup desktop_rviz_simulation.launch

# New Terminal
roslaunch niryo_robot_bringup desktop_gazebo_simulation.launch

roslaunch niryo_robot_bringup niryo_ned2_simulation.launch
